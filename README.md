- Alert when size is not selected

## Techs
- HTML
- Sass/SCSS
- JS
- React.js
- Context API (React.js)
- React Icons

## Notes & Improvements
- I could have used plain HTML/CSS/JS because it is a fairly simple web-page. Instead, I have used React.js, Context API and Sass/SCSS just so that I can show my skills learned up to this date.
- App.scss is used as _base.scss.
- index.scss is used as css reset.
- Forms and inputs might have been a better option for when selecting the size and submitting an item to cart.

## Updated
- Combine same size items in mini cart.
- Show item quantity next to the price in mini cart.
- Alert message UI.
- Retain hover on minicart component for desktop view.
- Delete items in the cart.
