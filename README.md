## Notes
- Could have used plain HTML/CSS/JS because it is fairly simple web-page. Instead, I used React.js to show skills I have learned.
- App.scss is used as _base.scss
- Alert message UI could have improved if there was more time.
- Form element could have been a better option for add to card submission and use input:radio for the size selections.
