## Skills
- HTML

## Notes & Improvements
- I Could have used plain HTML/CSS/JS because it is a fairly simple web-page. Instead, I used React.js, Context API and Sass just to apply more skills I have learned up to this date.
- App.scss is used as _base.scss.
- index.scss is used as css reset.
- Alert message UI could have improved if there was more time.
- Form element could have been a better option for adding an item to the cart, and use input:radio for the size selections.
