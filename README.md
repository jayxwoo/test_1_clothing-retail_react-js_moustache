## Skills
- HTML
- CSS
- Sass/SCSS
- JS
- React.js
- Context API (React.js)
- React Icons

## Notes & Improvements
- I could have used plain HTML/CSS/JS because it is a fairly simple web-page. Instead, I used React.js, Context API and Sass/SCSS just so that I can show skills I have learned up to this date.
- App.scss is used as _base.scss.
- index.scss is used as css reset.
- Form HTML element could have been used instead for size selection and 'ADD TO CART' submission.

## Updated
- Combine same size item in mini cart.
- Show item quantity next to the price in mini cart.
- Alert message UI.
